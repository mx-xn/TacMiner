{- Given a count of objects in a category, such that for every object at index
   n : ℕ there is an arrow to it from every other object { m : ℕ | m < n },
   compute all the possible compositions of arrows in that category.

   Note that this is sufficient to describe an "arrows only" definition of the
   category, since the existence of "objects" is indicated by their identity
   morphisms, and domain and codomain of morphisms by how they compose with
   those identities. -}
